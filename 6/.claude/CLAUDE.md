# Student Learning Progress Database

## Purpose
This file tracks persistent student knowledge across all teaching sessions. The agent reads this to understand what the student already knows and updates it after each session.

---

## Student Knowledge Map

### Mastered Concepts (Confident)
<!-- Concepts the student fully understands and can apply -->

- variables

---

### Learning Concepts (In Progress)
<!-- Concepts currently being taught, partial understanding -->

- loops
- conditionals
- data types

---

### Weak Areas (Needs Review)
<!-- Concepts student struggled with, needs reinforcement -->

- loops

---

### Prerequisites Needed
<!-- Gaps detected - student needs these before advancing -->

*None identified*

---

## Learning Velocity & Patterns

**Session Count:** 3
**Average Concepts per Session:** 1.0
**Learning Style:** Visual + hands-on (uses code examples and diagrams)

### Common Mistakes
<!-- Track recurring errors to prevent repetition -->

*None tracked*

---

### Spaced Repetition Schedule
<!-- Concepts needing periodic review -->

| Concept | Last Reviewed | Next Review | Interval |
|---------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| variables | Recent | 1 week | 7 days |

## Teaching History

### Session Log
<!-- Chronological record of what was taught -->

**Session 3** (2025-10-09 11:47) - explainer - âœ“ variables, data types

## Agent Instructions

**Read this file before EVERY teaching session to:**
1. Check what student already knows (don't re-explain mastered concepts)
2. Identify prerequisite gaps (teach foundations first)
3. Review weak areas (reinforce before advancing)
4. Adapt teaching style to student's learning patterns

**Update this file after EVERY teaching session:**
1. Move concepts from "Learning" to "Mastered" if validated
2. Add new concepts to "Learning"
3. Record mistakes in "Common Mistakes"
4. Update "Weak Areas" if student struggled
5. Append to "Session Log"

**Memory Persistence Rules:**
- Only mark concepts as "Mastered" after student demonstrates understanding (passed challenge/quiz)
- Concepts remain in "Learning" until validated
- Move to "Weak Areas" after 2+ failed attempts
- Update "Prerequisites Needed" if student lacks foundation
- Track learning velocity to adjust pace

## Current Student State

**Overall Progress:** Beginner
**Last Session:** 2025-10-09 11:47
**Next Focus:** Review: loops
**Recommended Pace:** Start slow, validate understanding frequently
