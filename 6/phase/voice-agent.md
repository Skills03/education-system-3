YES! Brilliant idea. You can absolutely use MCP to bridge context between the voice interface and teaching agent. Let me show you the
  architecture:

  Implementation Strategy

  OpenAI Realtime API Supports Server-Side Functions

  The Realtime API can call server-side tools/functions - this is where MCP comes in!

  // Realtime voice agent with context-aware functions
  const session = new RealtimeSession({
      tools: [
          {
              name: "get_teaching_context",
              description: "Get recent conversation history and student knowledge",
              parameters: { session_id: "string" }
          },
          {
              name: "ask_teaching_agent",
              description: "Delegate complex question to main teaching agent",
              parameters: { question: "string", session_id: "string" }
          },
          {
              name: "record_voice_learning",
              description: "Record what student learned via voice",
              parameters: { concepts: "array", session_id: "string" }
          }
      ]
  });

  Your Flask Backend Implements These as MCP Tools

  # tools/context_tools.py (NEW)

  @tool(
      "get_teaching_context",
      "Retrieve current teaching context for voice agent",
      {"session_id": str}
  )
  async def get_teaching_context(args):
      """Voice agent calls this to get context"""
      session_id = args["session_id"]
      session = sessions.get(session_id)

      return {
          "recent_messages": session.messages[-5:],  # Last 5 exchanges
          "student_knowledge": session.knowledge.get_summary(),
          "current_concepts": session.concept_permission.tracker.declared_concepts,
          "agent_mode": session.router.current_mode
      }


  @tool(
      "ask_teaching_agent",
      "Forward complex question from voice to main teaching agent",
      {"question": str, "session_id": str}
  )
  async def ask_teaching_agent(args):
      """Voice agent delegates to main agent for complex reasoning"""
      session_id = args["session_id"]
      question = args["question"]

      # Call the main teaching agent
      session = sessions[session_id]
      response = await session.teach(question)

      return {
          "answer": response,
          "used_tools": session.last_tools_used
      }


  @tool(
      "update_student_progress",
      "Voice agent reports what student learned",
      {"session_id": str, "concepts_learned": list, "interaction_type": str}
  )
  async def update_student_progress(args):
      """Keep teaching backend synchronized"""
      session_id = args["session_id"]
      concepts = args["concepts_learned"]

      session = sessions[session_id]
      session.knowledge.record_session(
          agent_used="voice",
          concepts_taught=concepts,
          success=True
      )
      session.knowledge.save()

      return {"status": "recorded"}

  Unified Flow Example

  Student Has Multi-Modal Learning Session:

  Student: [TEXT] "Explain bubble sort"
      ↓
  Teaching Agent (Claude):
      - Generates explanation
      - Uses diagram tool
      - Records: taught "bubble sort algorithm"
      - Session context updated

  Student: [VOICE] "Wait, can you explain the swapping part again?"
      ↓
  OpenAI Realtime Voice Agent:
      - Receives voice
      - Calls function: get_teaching_context(session_id)
      - Gets back: "Recently taught bubble sort, student knows arrays"
      - Generates contextualized voice response about swapping
      - Calls function: update_student_progress(concepts=["swap operation"])

  Student: [VOICE] "Now show me the code"
      ↓
  Realtime Voice Agent:
      - Recognizes need for code (complex)
      - Calls function: ask_teaching_agent("Show bubble sort code")
      - Teaching agent generates code example
      - Returns code to voice agent
      - Voice agent speaks: "I've sent the code to your screen, let me walk through it..."

  Student: [TEXT] "Can you make a video of it?"
      ↓
  Teaching Agent:
      - Has full context (bubble sort, swapping, code shown via voice)
      - Uses video generation tool
      - Records progress

  Result: Seamless context across text and voice!

  Implementation Architecture

  1. Separate Voice Service (Node.js/Python)

  // voice-service/server.js
  const express = require('express');
  const { RealtimeAgent } = require('@openai/agents/realtime');

  const app = express();

  // MCP client to connect to your teaching backend
  const mcpClient = new MCPClient({
      serverUrl: 'http://localhost:5000/mcp'
  });

  app.post('/voice/session', async (req, res) => {
      const { sessionId } = req.body;

      // Create voice agent with MCP tools
      const agent = new RealtimeAgent({
          instructions: `You are a voice assistant for programming education.
          Use get_teaching_context to understand what student is learning.
          For complex questions, use ask_teaching_agent to delegate.`,

          tools: [
              {
                  name: 'get_teaching_context',
                  handler: async (args) => {
                      return await mcpClient.call('get_teaching_context', args);
                  }
              },
              {
                  name: 'ask_teaching_agent',
                  handler: async (args) => {
                      return await mcpClient.call('ask_teaching_agent', args);
                  }
              },
              {
                  name: 'update_student_progress',
                  handler: async (args) => {
                      return await mcpClient.call('update_student_progress', args);
                  }
              }
          ]
      });

      // Return WebRTC connection details
      res.json({ voiceSessionUrl: agent.getConnectionUrl() });
  });

  2. Your Flask Backend Exposes MCP Context Tools

  # server.py (ADDITION)

  # New MCP server for context sharing
  context_bridge_tools = create_sdk_mcp_server(
      name="context_bridge",
      version="1.0.0",
      tools=[
          get_teaching_context,
          ask_teaching_agent,
          update_student_progress,
      ],
  )

  # Available to voice service
  @app.route('/mcp/call', methods=['POST'])
  def mcp_call():
      """Voice service calls this to access teaching context"""
      data = request.json
      tool_name = data['tool']
      args = data['arguments']

      # Execute MCP tool and return result
      result = execute_mcp_tool(tool_name, args)
      return jsonify(result)

  3. Frontend Integrates Both

  // Frontend
  class UnifiedEducationInterface {
      async startSession() {
          // Start text teaching session
          this.textSession = await fetch('/api/session/start').then(r => r.json());

          // Start voice session (shares same session ID)
          this.voiceSession = await fetch('/voice/session', {
              method: 'POST',
              body: JSON.stringify({
                  sessionId: this.textSession.session_id
              })
          }).then(r => r.json());

          // Connect voice
          await this.connectVoice(this.voiceSession.voiceSessionUrl);
      }

      async connectVoice(url) {
          this.voiceAgent = new RealtimeSession();
          await this.voiceAgent.connect({ url });

          // Voice agent now has context from teaching session!
      }
  }

  Benefits of This Architecture

  ✅ Unified Context
  - Voice agent knows what was just taught via text
  - Text agent knows what was discussed via voice
  - Shared student knowledge tracking

  ✅ Seamless Handoff
  - Complex questions: Voice → Teaching Agent
  - Simple clarifications: Voice handles directly
  - Both update same session state

  ✅ Best of Both Worlds
  - Low-latency voice (OpenAI Realtime)
  - Deep reasoning (Claude teaching agent)
  - Shared context (MCP bridge)

  ✅ Modular Architecture
  - Voice service can be separate deployment
  - Teaching backend stays focused
  - Connected via MCP protocol

  Should We Build This?

  My Recommendation: YES, this is architecturally sound!

  Phase 1 (Finish now):
  - Complete image editing integration
  - Test backend thoroughly

  Phase 2 (Next):
  - Add context bridge MCP tools
  - Build separate voice service
  - Integrate with shared session state

  Phase 3:
  - Frontend unified interface
  - Real student testing

  ---
  Want me to:
  1. Finish image editing first (in progress) ✅
  2. Then design voice + MCP context bridge (architectural deep dive)
  3. Implement voice service (separate service with MCP client)

  Sound good?
