DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

   - Root Directory: ./
   - Build Command: (leave empty)
   - Output Directory: ./

5. Wait 30 seconds

6. Your site will be live at:

AFTER DEPLOYMENT:

‚ö†Ô∏è Backend URLs still need configuration!

Each HTML file has this line (search for "BACKEND CONFIGURATION"):
- concept.html line ~417
- project.html line ~345
- visual.html line ~357

Change:
  const API_URL = '';

To:
  const API_URL = 'https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok.io';

Then redeploy on Vercel (it auto-redeploys from Git or re-upload folder)


TESTING:
--------

‚úì Click each card to test (won't work until backend URLs configured)
