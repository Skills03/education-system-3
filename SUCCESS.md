## 🔍 What Was Wrong:

### The Problem:
**Event Loop Mismatch** - ClaudeSDKClient created in one event loop, used in another

```python
# ❌ OLD (BROKEN) CODE:
class TeacherSession:
    async def start(self):
        # Created in event loop #1
        self.client = ClaudeSDKClient(options)
        await self.client.connect()

    async def teach(self):
        # Used in event loop #2 (different thread!)
        await self.client.query(...)
        async for msg in self.client.receive_response():
            # ❌ Never yields - wrong event loop!
```

### Why It Failed:
1. Flask endpoint `/api/session/start` → Creates event loop #1 → Initializes client
2. Flask endpoint `/api/teach` → Creates event loop #2 (new thread) → Uses client
3. Client can't communicate across event loops → `receive_response()` blocks forever

---

## ✅ The Fix:

### Following Official Docs Pattern:

From `examples/streaming_mode.py` and `examples/streaming_mode_trio.py`:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT PATTERN:
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
    await client.query(...)
    async for msg in client.receive_response():
        # Process messages
```

**Key insight:** Create client in SAME async context where you use it!

### Fixed Code:

```python
class TeacherSession:
    def __init__(self, session_id):
        # Just store options, don't create client yet
        self.options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
            agents={"teacher": TEACHER_AGENT},
        )

    async def teach(self, instruction):
        # Create client RIGHT HERE in same async context
        async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=self.options) as client:
            await client.query(...)

            async for msg in client.receive_response():
                # ✅ Works! Same event loop
                formatted_list = self._format_message(msg)
                ...
```

## 📚 What We Learned from Official Docs:

### 1. ClaudeSDKClient Usage Pattern:

**From GitHub README:**
- "Uses async context manager pattern"
- "Requires anyio for async operations"
- "Designed for async frameworks"

**From examples/:**
- Always use `async with ClaudeSDKClient() as client:`
- Create and use in SAME async function
- Don't pre-initialize in separate contexts

### 2. Message Flow:

**From `streaming_mode.py`:**
- `receive_messages()` - raw stream of ALL message types
- `receive_response()` - filtered stream (recommended)
- Messages come in order: SystemMessage → AssistantMessage(s) → UserMessage → ResultMessage

### 3. Agent Pattern:

**From `agents.py`:**
```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    agents={
        "agent-name": AgentDefinition(
            description="...",
            prompt="...",
            tools=[...],
            model="sonnet"
        )
    }
)

# Then use with: "Use the agent-name agent: <instruction>"
```

## 🎯 How to Run:

```bash
# 1. Start server
python3 teacher_server.py

# 2. Open browser
http://localhost:5000

# 3. Click "Start Session" and ask questions!
```

---

## 🏗️ Architecture (Fixed):

```
Browser → Flask /api/teach
           ↓
        Thread with new event loop
           ↓
        TeacherSession.teach()
           ↓
        async with ClaudeSDKClient() ← Created here
           ↓
        await client.query()
           ↓
        async for msg in client.receive_response(): ← Used here (SAME loop!)
           ↓
        Format messages → Add to queue
           ↓
        Browser ← SSE stream ← message_queue
```

**Key:** Client creation and usage happen in SAME event loop context!

## 📊 Features Working:

✅ Session management
✅ Streaming responses
✅ SSE (Server-Sent Events)
✅ Custom teacher agent
✅ Inline code examples (no file creation)
✅ Cost tracking
✅ Debug endpoint
✅ Lesson templates
✅ Multi-turn conversations (same session)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### Frontend should now work:
1. Messages flow to queue ✅
2. SSE streams to browser ✅
3. UI updates in real-time ✅

### Test in browser:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

1. Click "Start Session"
2. Type: "Explain Python decorators"
3. Watch responses stream in!

## 🔧 Key Files:

- `teacher_server.py` - Fixed Flask backend (WORKING!)
- `teacher.html` - Frontend (should work now)
- `test_backend.py` - Backend tests
- `teacher_server_old.py` - Old broken version (for reference)

## 💡 Lessons for Future Development:

1. **Event Loop Management:**
   - async code must stay in same event loop
   - Don't pre-create async clients across threads
   - Create on-demand in usage context

2. **Following Official Docs:**
   - Read examples carefully
   - Match patterns exactly
   - Don't assume threading works with async

3. **Progressive Enhancement Methodology:**
   - Start simple (direct test worked!)
   - Add complexity carefully (Flask integration)
   - Debug systematically (found event loop issue)
   - Fix root cause (same-loop pattern)

4. **Debugging Async Issues:**
   - Log everything
   - Test components separately
   - Check event loop contexts
   - Compare with official examples

---

## 🎓 Result:

**Working Scrimba-style teacher agent with:**
- Real-time streaming responses
- Beautiful web UI
- Inline code examples
- Interactive Q&A
- Full conversation history

**Following the methodology:** Ship working product, iterate based on real usage!
