# üîí IMMUTABLE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## What This Does

Creates a deployment where **NOTHING can be changed** - not code, not environment variables, not configuration. Even you cannot modify it without completely rebuilding.

## Why This Works

### 1. **Environment Variables Baked Into Image**
- NOT passed at runtime (can't be changed with `docker run -e`)
- Compiled directly into Docker layers
- Changing them requires rebuilding entire image

### 2. **SHA256 Cryptographic Lock**
- Container deployed by exact hash: `image@sha256:abc123...`
- Hash is cryptographic fingerprint of ENTIRE image
- Single bit change = completely different hash
- Cannot deploy modified version with same hash (cryptographically impossible)

### 3. **Read-Only Filesystem**
- `--read-only` flag prevents ALL writes to container filesystem
- Application cannot modify itself
- Cannot write config files, logs, or any data (except /tmp)

### 4. **Security Lockdown**
- `--cap-drop=ALL`: Removes all Linux capabilities
- `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`: Cannot escalate privileges
- `--tmpfs /tmp:noexec`: Even temp directory cannot execute binaries

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Deploy immutably
./deploy-immutable.sh

# Verify it's locked
docker inspect teacher-immutable | grep -A5 "ReadonlyRootfs"
```

## üî¨ How Immutable Is It?

### ‚úÖ CANNOT Be Changed:
- ‚úÖ Application code
- ‚úÖ Environment variables (.env)
- ‚úÖ Python dependencies
- ‚úÖ Configuration files
- ‚úÖ HTML templates
- ‚úÖ System files

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CAN Change (but loses data on restart):
- Files in `/tmp` (ephemeral)
- In-memory data (sessions, caches)

### ‚ùå CANNOT Change Without Rebuild:
Everything else. Period.

## üî• EXTREME OPTIONS (Nuclear Immutability)

If you want **ABSOLUTE** immutability where even rebuilding is hard:

### Option A: Delete Source After Deploy
```bash
# Deploy, then delete all source code
./deploy-immutable.sh
cd .. && rm -rf education/

# Now only the running container exists
# You'd need to pull from git to rebuild
```

### Option B: Blockchain Deployment (Akash Network)

**Why Blockchain?**
- Content-addressed by hash
- Decentralized (no single admin)
- Smart contracts enforce rules
- TRULY cannot change without everyone seeing

```bash
# Install Akash CLI
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash-network/node/master/install.sh | sh

# Deploy (creates immutable deployment manifest)
akash tx deployment create deploy.yaml --from wallet

# Once deployed, it's locked by blockchain consensus
```

**Cost**: ~$10-50/month, but TRULY immutable

### Option C: IPFS + Fleek (Most Extreme)

**IPFS = InterPlanetary File System**
- Content-addressed storage
- Hash = address of your app
- Changing content = different hash = different address

```bash
# Install IPFS
ipfs init

# Add your app (returns hash)
ipfs add -r /app

# Example output:
# QmX7H5nL4kRq8fKj9w2... (this is your app forever)

# Deploy to Fleek (hosts IPFS sites)
# Go to fleek.co, connect repo, deploy
# Gets permanent IPFS hash + ENS domain
```

**Result**: Content literally cannot change. New version = new hash = new URL.

## üìä Comparison Table

| Method | Code Immutable | ENV Immutable | Can Rebuild | Difficulty |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Docker SHA256 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes, if source exists | Easy |
| Docker + Delete Source | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå Need git | Medium |
| Akash Blockchain | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è Creates new deployment | Hard |
| IPFS/Fleek | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è New hash = new site | Medium |

## üõ°Ô∏è How To Verify Immutability

```bash
# 1. Check read-only filesystem
docker inspect teacher-immutable | grep ReadonlyRootfs
# Should show: "ReadonlyRootfs": true

# 2. Try to write to filesystem (should fail)
docker exec teacher-immutable touch /app/test.txt
# Error: Read-only file system

# 3. Check environment variables are baked
docker inspect teacher-immutable | grep -A10 "Env"
# Shows ENV vars in Config (not runtime)

# 4. Verify SHA256
cat .deployment-hash.txt
docker images --digests teacher-app:locked
# Hashes must match

# 5. Try to change env var (won't work)
docker run -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=fake teacher-app:locked
# Container uses baked-in key, ignores runtime override
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### You Cannot:
1. Hot-fix bugs (must rebuild)
2. Rotate API keys (must rebuild)
3. Update dependencies (must rebuild)
4. Change configuration (must rebuild)

### Trade-offs:
- **Security**: ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Maximum
- **Flexibility**: ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå Zero
- **Auditability**: ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Perfect
- **Rollback**: ‚úÖ‚úÖ Redeploy old hash

## üéØ When To Use This

### ‚úÖ Good For:
- Regulatory compliance (immutable audit trail)
- Production releases (no unauthorized changes)
- Security-critical apps (prevent tampering)
- Smart contracts / blockchain integration
- Forensic/legal evidence preservation

### ‚ùå Not Good For:
- Development environments
- Frequent updates
- A/B testing
- Apps needing config changes

## üîß Making Changes Later

To update your app:

```bash
# 1. Modify source code
# 2. Rebuild (creates NEW hash)
./deploy-immutable.sh

# 3. Old deployment keeps running with old hash
# 4. New deployment runs with new hash
# 5. Both are immutable, just different versions
```

## üö® ULTIMATE LOCK: Remove Admin Access

For government/compliance scenarios:

```bash
# 1. Deploy to cloud (AWS/GCP)
# 2. Remove your own admin permissions via IAM
# 3. Set up approval workflow requiring 3+ people
# 4. Now even YOU can't change it alone

# Example AWS:
aws iam remove-user-from-group --user-name you --group-name Admins
```

## üìù Legal/Compliance Notes

This deployment creates:
- **Non-repudiation**: SHA256 hash proves exact code running
- **Tamper-proof**: Filesystem read-only + cryptographic lock
- **Audit trail**: Hash logged in .deployment-hash.txt
- **Reproducible**: Same Dockerfile = same hash

Good for:
- SOC 2 compliance
- HIPAA immutable logs
- Financial regulations (SOX)
- Government contracts

## ‚ö° Quick Reference

```bash
# Deploy
./deploy-immutable.sh

# Verify
docker inspect teacher-immutable | grep ReadonlyRootfs

# View logs (only thing you CAN do)
docker logs -f teacher-immutable

# Stop (destructive)
docker stop teacher-immutable

# Restart same deployment
SHA=$(cat .deployment-hash.txt)
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --read-only teacher-app@${SHA}
```

---

**Bottom Line**: After running `./deploy-immutable.sh`, your code and environment are cryptographically locked. Change requires complete rebuild with new hash. Most immutable solution short of blockchain.
