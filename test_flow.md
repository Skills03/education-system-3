# Testing Flow for Scrimba Teacher

## What Changed:

‚úÖ **Teacher now teaches INLINE** - No file creation, just markdown code blocks
‚úÖ **Added comprehensive logging** - Every step logged with ‚úì or ‚ùå
‚úÖ **Frontend console debugging** - See all messages in browser console
‚úÖ **Better error handling** - Errors flow to frontend

## How to Test:

### 1. Restart Server
```bash
# Kill old server (Ctrl+C)
python3 teacher_server.py
```

### 2. Open Browser
- **IMPORTANT:** Open http://localhost:5000 (NOT file://)
- Open browser console (F12)
- ‚úÖ HTML served from same origin = No CORS issues!

### 3. Start Session
- Click "Start Session"
- **Watch terminal** for: `‚úì Session <id> connected successfully`
- **Watch console** for: `‚úÖ SSE Connected`

### 4. Send Message
- Type: "Teach me Python list comprehensions"
- Click Send
- **Watch terminal** for:
  ```
  Teaching: Teach me...
  Query sent, receiving response...
  Received message #1, type: AssistantMessage
  ‚úì Formatted message: teacher - Let me teach you...
  ‚úì Added to queue. Queue size: 1
  ```
- **Watch console** for:
  ```
  üì® Received message: {type: 'teacher', content: '...'}
  ‚ûï Adding message to UI: teacher
  ```

## Expected Behavior:

1. **Terminal shows:**
   - Session creation
   - Query received
   - Messages formatted and queued
   - Completion signal

2. **Browser console shows:**
   - SSE connection
   - Messages received
   - UI updates

3. **Browser UI shows:**
   - Teacher responses appear
   - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
   - No file creation actions

## If Still Not Working:

### Debug Checklist:
- [ ] Terminal shows `‚úì Added to queue. Queue size: X`
- [ ] Console shows `üì® Received message:`
- [ ] Check for errors in either

### Quick Debug:
```bash
# Get session ID from browser console, then:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/debug/<session-id>
```

This will show the queue contents!
